# Preliminary support for 1.17

After many days and nights spent working on a temporary solution (and trust me, this is definitely temporary), we've gotten something done: support for 1.17 is here. With backporting work done by artdeell and Java 17 ported by DuyKhanhTran, 1.17 is usable and playable with gl4es. 

Here's how to get it to work. You need to have a **GitHub account** in order to download the builds and JRE. Regardless of your platform, you'll need to download [this resource pack](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/724164160761626624/860864619350065162/assets-v0.zip). This is artdeell's patch for 1.17 on gl4es.

• Known issues:
- [Android only] Crosshair icon doesn’t render.
- Tell us

### Android:
- Get latest build: [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions?query=branch%3Av3_openjdk). You need to download the `noruntime` build in order to able to install JRE17 runtime.
- Get JRE17: [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions?query=branch%3Abuildjre16). You need to download the artifact that matches your device architecture: `jre17-<architecture>`, don’t pick jdk17 or debuginfo.
- Install the APK, it will be displayed as second app if you have one installed before.
- Install the downloaded JRE17 runtime on the second app.
- Go to launcher settings, switch renderer to gl4es 1.1.5 - OpenGL ES 2 or 3.
- Enable show hidden folder on your file manager.
- Go to `/sdcard/games/PojavLauncher/.minecraft/resourcepacks`, place the downloaded resource pack here.
- Go up (go to `.minecraft folder), edit options.txt: modify resourcePacks key:
```
resourcePacks:["assets-v0.zip"]
```
- Now launch Minecraft 1.17 and enjoy!

### iOS:
- Get latest build: [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS/actions?query=branch%3Amain)
- After install, go to /Applications/PojavLauncher.app/Frameworks
- Rename libgl4es_114.dylib to other name.
- Make a symlink of libgl4es_115.dylib to libgl4es_114.dylib.
- Go to `/var/mobile/Documents/minecraft/resourcepacks`, place the downloaded resource pack here.
- Go up (go to `minecraft` folder), edit options.txt: modify resourcePacks key: 
```
resourcePacks:["assets-v0.zip"]
```
- Now launch Minecraft 1.17 and enjoy!

Until we get a more permenant solution to fix 1.17 and newer, this is what we have. It's not perfect, but it works. We hope to see a version of gl4es that translates OpenGL 3 to OpenGL ES, or continue to work on Zink as a backup method if all else fails.*
